## What it does
Fly Frenzy is a web application which finds the cheapest flight ticket price between two cities. The user can even subscribe to notifications, which notifies them whenever there's a cheaper option available between those two cities. The user gets an email and SMS with price, how much cheaper it is compared to the last time they saw the price, and even a link to the booking website. All these without signing up or any such lengthy processes.

## How we built it
We've used the following technologies to build our application:
- NextJS for front-end
- Python + Flask for back-end API and cron job
- MongoDB for database
- Courier for sending notifications
